Repo with my solutions to the 2023 advent of code.

I want to use this year's advent of code as an opportunity to learn Lisp,
(Common Lisp specifically), so all my solutions MUST be in Common Lisp 
(note to myself). I am new to Lisp, so my solutions may not be the most idiomatic
Lisp code, although this is what I am striving for.

## Environment
My environment for anyone curious is:
- [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) v3.0.0
  - With `:editor lispy` and `:lang common-lisp` enabled in my `init.el`
- With SBCL v2.3.10
- On Arcolinux:
   ```
NAME=ArcoLinux
ID=arcolinux
ID_LIKE=arch
BUILD_ID=rolling

HOME_URL="https://arcolinux.info/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://arcolinuxforum.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://github.com/arcolinux"
LOGO=arcolinux-hello
   ```

## Resources used
The resources that I'm using for anyone curious are:
- _ANSI Common Lisp_ by Paul Graham (ISBN 0-13-370875-6)
- _A Programmer's Guide to Common Lisp_ by Deborah G. Tatar (ISBN 0-932376-87-8)

## Contributing
If anyone somehow happens to come across this and feels so moved to 
help me better my solutions, pull requests with explanations are welcome!
